# Roadmap / Brainstorm

-- Separate the files into lines and have a scripting language to guide the reader --  
-- Record the audio file of the script ALSO saying the script KEYWORDS to make the program split the words --  
-- Gather the timstamps of each line --  


## Ideas

- [x] Using speech recognition to find the keywords and aid the separation of the timestamps
