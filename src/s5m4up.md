So this one has been ongoing for a while, but... The Nutcrackers.

My hometown (where I no longer live, but still have family so I keep apprised of local matters) has decided, in a bizarre bid to increase tourism, to become The Nutcracker Town.

The reason? An older woman donated her nutcracker collection to the historical society. Something like 2,500 nutcrackers. I think because her kids told her flat out they would dispose of them after she died if she did not make alternate arrangements.

So, the town decided, well, they had all these nutcrackers on display. This could be good for tourism. We could be known for something.

People were bewildered and predictably upset. A lot of townsfolk don't *want* to be the nutcracker town. All the local businesses have been pressured to buy these giant expensive cardboard nutcrackers from the local print shop. They are *terrifying.*

There's been general outcry. Facebook groups, the whole nine yards. And still the town persists. Still there are these hollow-eyed giant cartoonish cardboard nutcrackers everywhere you look.

Edit: Someone guessed it, so I have effectively triangulated myself (internet safety fail 101). If you want to see some local news on the subject, [look no further.](https://www.keloland.com/news/eye-on-keloland/history-center-hopes-to-have-more-nutcrackers-than-people-in-luverne/)

Edit 2: Okay, since many people have asked (and not everyone can access the news sites), I've attempted to upload a picture of [the cardboard nutcrackers.](https://i.imgur.com/lVQ9zUd.jpg) Let me know if it doesn't work and I'll give it another go!

Sheep:

Whether or not to continue allowing a flock of sheep to graze on the town green (with a petting area for lambs).

Some think the sheep do a fine job of keeping the grass under control (and fertilized) - others want landscaping professionals to do the job.

Building a road to connect the turnpike to the interstate and another toll rode.  As someone who moved to a small, rural area from a metropolitan area, I can absolutely see the benefits of this, and I think it can be done in an environmentally responsible way.  Some of the "born and raised" don't see it.  I love that were in a small town/rural area and the appreciation of nature.  But our community will die out if we don't have a reason and work to keep our kids here.

We have a mural painted on a wall consisting of about 30 random people just smiling. This mural is pretty old. The artist took the first 30 or so volunteers to be painted on this wall. There has never been a problem with this mural until a little over a year ago when people decided it’s racist because everyone painted is white so it must be that “the artist hates minorities and the city is racist for allowing him to do this.” The mural is now called “the wall of exclusion” and people are trying to get it painted over.

Local pizza place fired all its staff mysteriously last summer and closed for a few weeks. Naturally, rumors fly right away. Turns out the Mormon owner (who liked to parade his family as the paragon of small town virtue) was having affairs with multiple staff members. The wife kicked him out, fired anyone who knew, and then rehired and trained a bunch of new staff.

One of the fired staff members then opens her own pizza place to rave reviews in the nearest town over. OG pizza place announces it will close at the end of the year - right after they run a promo for gift cards. People are pissed they only have a few weeks to use the gift cards they just bought (and were planning to give as Christmas presents) After weeks of record sales, OG pizza place announces they're staying open after all and now people are pissed they used up the cards they'd intended to give as gifts.

Tl;dr: one pizza owner is disgraced, his wife kicks him out and takes over, then his mistress opens a competing business. Then a bait &amp; switch about closing leads the entire town to be pissed off.

EDIT: I just got off the phone with my dad and he told me that new pizza place was actually founded by TWO mistress. I straight up didn't believe him and he sent me the website for the new place. Yep, Mistress #2 is a manager. And their pizza names are all spinoffs of OG pizza place.

Small town in the north of England. There was a machete attack in a student/staff accommodation building over drugs. Everyone a little bit on edge, doors locked when they normally wouldn’t be. 

Except it never happened. One girl made up a story, said story spread like wild fire. Normally I’d say no harm really done but because the rumour included someone central Asian or black, people are being awful. Small town racism is higher than ever. 

Half the town knows it never happened, the other half is using it to validate their miserable views. 

I miss city living.

# Comment 36
A woman on the city council constantly spouts about cleaning up the admittedly horrible drug problem in town and goes on sanctimonious rants on social media about it.

Her son is the main dealer in town. He lives in her house. It's not a secret at all and he gets arrested for shit all the time and she gets him off the hook every time.

Full disclosure I don't live there anymore thankfully but most of my family does.

Edit: I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it is to thin competition. Although to be perfectly honest the town is only like 1,000 strong and he really doesn't *have* competition. Mostly because people know his mom can pull a few strings and fuck you over or just run you out of town.

They are widening the sidewalks on main street through town. The plans have been available and  has been going through red tape for years. Part of the plan is parallel parking on a small section.It got the ok and a bunch of people including my aunt went down to complain. It would appear that those people including my aunt have no idea what the plans look like nor did they provide them at the townhall meeting they just don't want parallel parking. I looked at what the end result would be and it's an absolute necessity. Tldr people hate change.

Crazy high cost of living by greedy landlords. My small, isolated town is a college town in the middle of Upper Michigan. The cost for these old, barely up-kept houses are going for about $500/$600 per room. Usually 4 "bedroom" houses (some rooms could barely fit more than a queen bed). Mainly targeting college kids with financial help from parents or simply no sense of value when it comes to money. 

Also, It seems that the work from home option has inspired people to move to more scenic, isolated area. It's even been advertised as a great place to live in bigger cities like Chicago. That shot the market rates way up. Wealthier people from cities are buying houses here, regardless of cost, and either moving here or turning them into rentals, adding to the rental crisis. And don't even get the locals started on AirBnb! They could be rented out to people in need of housing but instead are seen as hotels for tourists rather than helping the community first.

TL;DR the cost of housing is absurd for what is offered, and there's not much for substitutes, being that it's an isolated town.

# Comment 55
City just banned plastic bags and has implemented a green initiative where restaurants and coffee shops now charge you a fee for both paper bags and cups. The charge of the bag and the cup don’t go to the city, it goes right back to the company with the hope they’ll enact some environmental initiatives of their own. If you don’t want to pay for the paper bag at McDonald’s that used to be no charge they’ll just hand you everything individually.

# Comment 56
The location of a veterans memorial. There is a lot of construction and the city wants to move the veterans memorial (just a plaque) about 150ft to a new spot where it will have a little park and sitting area. Half of the Vets and some conservative city council members are PISSED and making all sorts of noise. City is confused because it’s actually a better memorial, only 150ft away from the original. 

City council elections begin to use this as their platform. Facebook fights galore. It was amazing.

The developer in our HOA community that owns ~1200 undeveloped lots has purchased a 25 acre plot of land which is adjacent to the housing development and wants to build it out with 142 townhome type rental units which would not be a part of our HOA development. Many people that live here are absolutely losing their shit. Most of the objections center around how the rental units are most likely to go unoccupied and will subsequently be "designated" section 8 housing. Lots of "well I heard" type of comments and other blatant lies. I'm kind of neutral as it will be in my backyard BUT there is a real need for "affordable housing" for local coast guard, navy, and NASA contractor personel, let alone just normal people. The entire "affordable housing" line has been taken by many to clearly mean "low income housing". Pretty entertaining. Managed to get myself kicked out of the anti development FB group after calling out people for bitching about the local volunteer fire department not giving them a free fire hall rental to host their meeting. I've moved on to other hobbies, haha. Also eye opening with respect to how shitty many of my neighbors are.

I live on an Island in the Georgia Straight just off Vancouver Island.  It's a popular summer destination for people.  The Airbnb culture has kind of gentrified the island.  With the cost of real estate right now. People from the lower mainland (Vancouver,  Washington, California, Oregon ect) are the only ones who can afford real estate and even if they are from here and able to afford property, they'd rather make a premium renting for vacationers than give real locals a place to live at a fair price.  There's a lot of people hard working people that grew up here, that are slowly coming to the realization they can no longer live here.

About a year ago my hometowns favorite eating establishment burnt down. Lotta people pooled money to get him a new spot. A failing car salesman converted his place to a restaurant and partnered with the beloved restaurant owner. Business was thriving, food was fantastic and it was THE place to get food. The failing car salesman was talking and then some to the local bicycle behind his wife's back and was giving her free drinks and the two would stay at the place way beyond closing time. One of her kids went on her phone and was scrolling and found nudes on her phone of car salesman. The kid sent it to his friends and the friends sent it to even more people. Now basically the entire town has seen this red headed man nude wearing cowboy boots. Beloved restaurant owner quit and business is no longer booming because he has no cook. Car salesman is getting a divorce and closing the restaurant and this happened only 4 days ago.

Edit 1: Wow! Thank you everyone for the upvotes! This post has more upvotes than the population of my hometown (1.7k)

Edit 2: sorry for the confusion regarding local bicycle. I told this story as if it's to someone in my town who would just understand so that's on me. Reddit we gotta talk, a lot of you are trying to stand up for this lass, good on you, but she's a lady with 21 kids with 19 different lads and all but 4 have a reputation in the town. The 4 that don't are because the fathers have full custody of them. She's really not a very redeemable character in this situation. 

Edit 3: a few asked for the photo to be uploaded and what the heck!? Lol you guys are wild!

Edit 4: so the beloved restaurant owner left the car salesmans restaurant partnership because of this fiasco. Some say there was some tension about how the business was ran and some say there was tension because he was cheating on his wife. 

Status Update: the latest rumor off the old grape vine says the restaurant owner got a killer deal from the local real estate guy and will renovate an old closed business downtown into his new restaurant! Fingers crossed because he really knows his stuff.

One member of the council keeps voting down anything that would help with the insane deer problem in town. Its illegal to feed them, but people still do it with no consequences. The deer have caused so many car accidents, including fatal ones. They have also done over a thousand dollars worth of property damage on my property alone. 


They are literally like rats with hooves here. I had to stop letting my dogs roam my fenced in yard even partially unsupervised in order to keep them from eating the insane level of deer poop in my yard.

County scale: the council voted to redistrict based on maps that they made themselves. It was vetoed in favor of one made by an outside firm. They overrode it. Gerrymandering to hell and back

Town scale: They're gonna demo the empty Sears building and I'm trying to find how and when so we can go watch it implode or something. Not controversial just wild.

Very local scale: the 102 year old pillar of the community died and two pastors were fighting over who got to preside over the service. Neither could achieve a victory so they just. Recited the same prayers after each other. It was weird.

Extended family scale: At this funeral I mentioned the "guy with the bulldozer" who digs the graves and was informed that's my second cousin. I blurted out the only thing I know about him, which is that he owes my parents 400$ for double charging them for digging my grandfather's grave. His wife was there. We don't know if she heard me or not. My mom isn't pleased.
